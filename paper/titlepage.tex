\citet{bowers2013sutva} showed that one could use Fisher's randomization-based
hypothesis testing framework to assess counterfactual causal models of
treatment propagation and spillover across social networks.  This research
note improves the statistical infernce presented in \citet{bowers2013sutva}
(henceforth BFP) by substituting a test statistic based on a sum of squared
residuals and incorporating information about the fixed network for the simple
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic  \citep[\S 5.4]{MylesHollander1999a}
that they used. The point of this short article is to incrementally improve
the use of BFP's ``reasoning about interference'' approach. We do not offer
results about test statistics for multi-parameter causal models on social
networks here, but instead hope that this research note stimulates further,
and deeper, work on test statistics and sharp hypotheses.
