===========================

Test statistic selection for randomization inference with interference.

## How to use this repository?

First get the repository and the associated files (RItools and the Bibliography database):

```
git clone https://github.com/jwbowers/TestStatRIInterference.git
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Then use the Makefile to build the paper.

Some of the simulations take a very long time (more than 24 hours) on a cluster with 36 cores. We save the products of these runs in a Dropbox directory.
